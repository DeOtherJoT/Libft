Test files in progress for each individual function. 
If for some reason you think you wanna use this I suggest using this to test
every individual function before integrating them into the main header file.

To test everything I suggest using the other more sophisticated libft 
testers that have been created by those before us (and more determined than
I am).

Cheers.
