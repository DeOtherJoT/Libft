The completed_.c folder would contoin the completed .c files as well as the 
Makefile and libft.h files, aka the folder I wanna submit. WIP as of now.

The test_files folder would contain the individual test files for the more
complex functions (I don't need one for toupper cause the concept is easy.)

Maybe later I would compile all of it into a big main test file to test 
everything, but I'll see how that would turn out.
